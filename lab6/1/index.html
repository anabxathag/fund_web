    <h1>Programming language</h1>
    <p>A programming language is a formal language 
        which comprises a set of instructions used to produce 
        various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to 
        create programs that implement specific algorithms. </p>

            <h1>C</h1>
            <p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, 
                supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, 
                while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p>

            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language 
                for general-purpose programming. Python has a design philosophy

            <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, 
            class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few
            implementation dependencies as possible.
