        <p>If the alien features and multitudinous legs of a <b>millipede</b> 
        or <b>centipede</b> aren't enough to give you nightmares, meet the Arthropleura 
        — and be lucky that these are one of the many megafauna species that are extinct. 
        Their shape would be familiar to anyone who's encountered a millipede, 
        but it's their size that really makes them such apparently scary animals. 
        The Arthropleura was capable of reaching a length of over eight feet. 
        That makes them the largest <b>invertebrates</b> on record, and it was once believed 
        that they were voracious and wandering predators. But more recent research indicates 
        these rank among creatures that are harmless despite looking frightening.</p>
        
        <p>Ultimately, changes in the environment led to the downfall of this massive invertebrate. 
        High concentrations of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere and a distinct lack of large 
        predators allowed Arthropleura to thrive for a time, but this millipede's unique physiology 
        eventually became unsustainable.</p>

        <p>While none of them can match Arthropleura in size, you can learn about 
        the five largest millipedes still alive <b>here</b>.</p>
