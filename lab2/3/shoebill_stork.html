        <p>These scary animals of the tropics poses no threat at all to humans 
        and have been known to let researchers get mere feet away from them 
        comfortably, but the bizarre shoe-shaped beak attached to their face 
        is still a terrifying weapon in the wild — and that's earned 
        this avian a position as the creepiest bird on Earth. Size has 
        a big part to play in this. <b>Shoebills</b> may be gangly, but they can 
        reach a height of five feet and a wingspan of roughly seven feet. 
        That size allows them to hunt down large prey like <b>catfish</b>, <b>eels</b>, 
        and even <b>baby crocodiles</b> as a matter of course. But it's their method 
        of hunting that's the scariest thing about them.</p>

        <p>These storks will fall headfirst with their beaks open to trap live 
        prey whole. The stork will then open its mouth slightly and decapitate 
        them with its razor-sharp beak when they try to escape. These birds 
        are even known to fight fully grown crocodiles, and their mating call 
        sounds alarmingly like a machine gun.</p>
