        <p>As if a bird-eating spider wasn't scary enough, 
            meet the <b>crab</b> capable of doing the same. 
            They've been known to feast on <b>rats</b>, domesticated <b>chickens</b>, 
            and even <b>kittens</b>. These scary animals have also been known 
            to cannibalize one another with little hesitation. 
            These are the largest land crabs on Earth with 
            a width of three feet and a length of a foot and a half 
            — and their overgrown claws are known to be 
            capable of exerting pressure that can rival the <b>bite 
            force</b> of <b>bears</b> and <b>cheetahs</b>. They often use these claws 
            to tear at the flesh of any prey they can find, but 
            this crab's exceptional exertion is primarily used to 
            crack open coconuts in their <b>Pacific</b> island habitats. 
            Their well-documented habits for being voracious eaters 
            have even led to a compelling theory: that they were 
            responsible for the disappearance of Amelia Earhart's body 
            and that they might have even devoured her while alive.</p>
