        <p>The long-dead megarachne was a spider capable of reaching 
        a length of nearly two feet - but if you remove spiders 
        that are extinct from the equation, the biggest and scariest 
        arachnid on the record is likely the Goliath bird-eating spider. 
        The Goliath tarantula is known to reach a width of nearly one foot, 
        but its size isn't the only intimidating thing about it. 
        The inch-long fangs make a pretty persuasive argument for many predators 
        to stay away, and the Goliath tarantula is covered in sharp and bristled 
        hairs that can be rubbed together to make a hissing noise or flung 
        like quills at any threatening animals.</p>

        <p>Despite its name, <b>birds</b> are actually a rare part of <b>this spider's diet</b>. 
        But those that do get caught are in for a horrifying fate. After disabling prey 
        with neurotoxins, this tarantula will inject their prey with digestive juices 
        which then liquify everything but the animal's skin and bones.</p>
