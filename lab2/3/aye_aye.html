        <p>A resident of <b>Madagascar</b>, the <b>aye-aye</b> is easily the most unusual 
        looking <b>lemur</b> in the world — but while some people find these primates 
        to fall into the category of animals that are so ugly that they're cute, 
        that's not an impression that's generally shared by the locals 
        who share a habitat with the aye-aye.</p>

        <p>As nocturnal and elusive creatures, their wild eyes and demonic features 
        can make them look positively terrifying on sight, and many Malaysian 
        communities kill aye-ayes on sight out of a belief that they're 
        a harbinger of bad luck or that they use their bony and ghoulish 
        middle fingers to pierce the hearts of <b>humans</b> in their sleep. 
        The truth is that these fingers actually developed as a way 
        of finding <b>grubs</b> and other invertebrate prey hiding in trees 
        through echolocation. Despite ranking near the top of the list 
        of animals that are harmless, they're highly <b>endangered</b> thanks to 
        these superstitions and to commercial deforestation.</p>
